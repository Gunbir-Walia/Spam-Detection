# Spam-Detection - Natural Language Processing Project
This project implements a binary text classification system to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages, addressing real-world challenges in automated email and message filtering.

## Training Data
This contains a CSV file with 3619 labeled samples, of which 1068 are classified as 'spam' and 2551 as 'not-spam'. This dataset size is sufficient to train a machine learning model capable of learning the distinguishing features between legitimate and spam messages.

## Test Data
This contains a CSV file with 1552 unlabelled samples. The model is required to perform inference on this dataset and accurately classify each sample as either 'spam' or 'not-spam'.

## Results 
The python notebook generates a CSV file with predictions on the unlabelled dataset and stores it in your working directory.
